# 11/27-kanban-board

This project is all about building a kanban board that can be used to manage
tasks and projects. (but it'll be just static demo, due to time constraints)

I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and
will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and for styling
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
also will use same structure from
[00-custom-drag-and-drop](https://github.com/kruzkasu223/00-custom-drag-and-drop).

If you are interested, checkout
